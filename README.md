## Introduction

algolib is a repository aimed at providing a comprehensive collection of algorithms that can be used in various programming projects. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this repository can serve as a valuable resource for understanding and implementing algorithms efficiently.

## Installation

To use algolib, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/algolib.git
```

## Usage

Once you have cloned the repository, you can explore the different algorithms available in the `src` directory. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file, making it easy to understand and use.

To run the algorithms, navigate to the respective language directory and execute the corresponding file. For example, if you want to run the binary search algorithm, you can do the following:

1. Modify the `src/main.cpp` file to call the binary_search function.
2. Use CMake to build the project
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./main
```

Feel free to modify and adapt the algorithms to suit your specific needs. Contributions are also welcome!
